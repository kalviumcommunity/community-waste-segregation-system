# community-waste-segregation-system

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Community-Driven Waste Segregation Reporting System** is a web-based application designed to improve waste segregation at the source by enabling collaboration between households, waste collectors, and municipal authorities.  
The system focuses on real-time reporting, community visibility, and data-driven decision-making to reduce mixed waste and landfill burden.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Municipal waste management systems often fail to monitor and enforce waste segregation due to:
- Lack of real-time, ground-level data  
- Low citizen engagement  
- Weak accountability mechanisms  

This results in inefficient recycling and increased landfill usage.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal
To build a **community-driven digital platform** that tracks waste segregation practices, encourages positive behavior, and provides actionable insights to authorities.
